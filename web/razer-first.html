			<h1>Razer Phone</h1>
			<p>It is always refreshing to see a new face on the smartphone landscape, especially one as reputable as Razer, a major player on the thriving PC gaming scene.</p>
			
			<p>
				You don't necessarily have to appreciate Razer's style and portfolio, but you'll most likely agree that the "PC master race" audience is a tough one to please. Razer has made a name for itself by managing to do just that, catering to the fickle gamer crowd's whims and fancies.

			<p>
				This is probably the best kind of track record to bring along when setting off to explore Android as a mobile gaming niche. An idea that few have dared to pursue. Mobile gaming is far from dead, nor is it a niche activity per se. Quite on the contrary, it's a growing fad and probably the one that's best equipped to accommodate a busy modern lifestyle.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the rapid advances in hardware performance and a growing number of serious, competitive gaming titles, such as MOBAs, making their way on to the Android platform, it seems like a matter of time for more gaming brands to hop on the mobile hardware bandwagon. If there is money to be made, that is.
			</p>
				Enter the Razer Phone, the first phone to dare bring a high refresh rate screen to the traditional Android markets. An impressive 120HZ IGZO screen is easily the single most impressive novelty but the rest of the spec sheet is painting a pretty solid 2017 flagship picture.
			<p>
				It is a true powerhouse, the Razer-phone, no doubt about it. Even with the few major omissions noted above. And with the Razer brand behind it, it is sure to get plenty of exposure to just the right crowds. But the real question is, will Razer finally punch through where so many have already failed.
